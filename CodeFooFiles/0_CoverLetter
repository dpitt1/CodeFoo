Hey Code-Foo!

My name is David, and I would love to join your team this summer.

Coding is like building a house with infinite material and no gravity. There are (almost) no rules. If you can think it, you can make it.

Web development, it seems to me, is like building a an intergalactic space station, with flexible laws of physics and time-travel enabled. Once you're connected to the web, the imagination can really go nuts.

I want to build these space stations, and good ones too: ones that are fast, take you anywhere you want to go, and simple enough for a n00b to operate.

Currently, I am a student of computer science at Stanford. And while a university CS education is excellent, it doesn't give me everything I need. Some tricks of the trade can be learned best from the pros in the industry. And who better to supplement a CS education than IGN? I mean, let's be real. Gamers are the best at this stuff anyway.

So that's why I want to work at Code-Foo Academy. Plus, your office looks bomb, I'm sure the people working at IGN are similarly bomb, and I look forward to gaming with the best.

Thanks for considering me.

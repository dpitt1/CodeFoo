Note on the Rift Item database entry form:

I tried to make the item object (and entry form) suitable for Wiki-style item descriptions, as per IGN's Item Wiki:

http://rift.ign.com/wiki/Rift_Wiki

I took "item" to mean any weapon, armor, accessory, or consumable in the game.

Please excuse messiness of the image. Penmanship is not my strong point =)
